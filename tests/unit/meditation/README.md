# Meditation Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the Meditation module of Garden Calm.

## Purpose:

These tests verify the correct functioning of meditation-related components:

- Meditation library and content management
- State matching between emotions and appropriate meditations
- Meditation generation functionality (R1-powered)
- Audio processing for TTS-based meditations

Unit tests here ensure that meditations are correctly selected, generated, and processed based on user's emotional state.
