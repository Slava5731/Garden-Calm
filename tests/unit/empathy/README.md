# Empathy Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the Empathy module of Garden Calm.

## Purpose:

These tests verify the correct functioning of the Empathy Meter, emotion analysis, and suggestion engine components. They ensure that:

- Emotion codes are correctly classified
- Empathy scores are properly accumulated
- Suggestion thresholds work as expected
- Context management functions properly

Unit tests here focus on isolated testing of empathy-related functionality without external dependencies.
